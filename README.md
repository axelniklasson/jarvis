# Jarvis
Code base for what is supposed to become a somewhat working home automation system.

## Development
Make sure [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) is installed and then run 
```
git clone https://github.com/axelniklasson/jarvis.git && cd jarvis
virtualenv .
source bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

That's it really.
